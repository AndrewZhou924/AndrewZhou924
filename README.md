# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am (Andrew) Zhanke Zhou

I am a Ph.D. student at [TMLR group](https://bhanml.github.io/group.html) of Hong Kong Baptist University, advised by [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) and working with [Prof. Jiangchao Yao](https://sunarker.github.io/).
Currently, I am a visiting student at [STAIR lab](https://stair.cs.stanford.edu/team/) of Stanford University, working with [Prof. Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/).
Prior to that, I was a visiting student at [LARS group](https://lars-group.github.io/pages/group.html) of Tsinghua University, working with [Prof. Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io/) and [Prof. Yongqi Zhang](https://yzhangee.github.io/).

My research focuses on **trustworthy machine reasoning with foundation models (LLMs, VLMs)** to solve **complex problems** (math, coding) and accelerate scientific discovery and application in fields like biology, chemistry, and healthcare. I believe that **reasoning** is the essential pathway to achieving AGI. Trustworthy machine reasoning encompasses properties such as reasoning power, robustness, safety, and explainability. My work involves developing methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical foundations to advance these areas. The image below inspires me a lot! Please refer to [my homepage](https://andrewzhou924.github.io/) for details. 

I am always open to possible collaborations. *Please feel free to [email me](mailto:cszkzhou@comp.hkbu.edu.hk) for research, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
