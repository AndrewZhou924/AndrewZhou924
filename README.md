# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Zhanke Zhou

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) Group in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, 
advised by Dr. [Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/), and work closely with Dr. [Quanming Yao](https://lars-group.github.io/).

My research interests lie in Machine Learning, 
particularly in **Automated and Trustworthy Machine Reasoning** 
with **Structure Data** (e.g., Graphs) and **Foundation Models** (e.g., LLM or VLM). 
The image below inspires me a lot!
