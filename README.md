# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Zhanke Zhou (Andrew)

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) Group in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, advised by Dr. [Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/).

My research focuses on trustworthy machine reasoning with foundation models to solve complex problems such as mathematics, coding, and planning, as well as to accelerate scientific discovery and application in fields like biology, chemistry, and healthcare.

I believe that reasoning is the essential pathway to achieving AGI. Trustworthy machine reasoning encompasses properties such as reasoning power, robustness, safety, and explainability. My work involves developing methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical foundations to advance these areas.

Please refer to [my homepage](https://andrewzhou924.github.io/) for details. The image below inspires me a lot!

I am always open to possible collaborations. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:cszkzhou@comp.hkbu.edu.hk)!
